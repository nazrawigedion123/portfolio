Go is a garbage-collected language, which means memory management is largely handled for you. But understanding _how_ the GC works — and how to work _with_ it — is critical for building high-performance applications.

## What is a Garbage Collector?

A garbage collector (GC) handles memory free-ups and memory allocation for variables. It tracks which memory is still in use and reclaims what isn't. While this frees you from manual memory management, it comes at a cost: the GC consumes CPU cycles and can introduce latency during collection cycles.

## Memory Location: Stack vs Heap

The Go compiler decides where to allocate a variable — either on the **stack** or the **heap**.

| Property    | Stack                          | Heap                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Speed       | Extremely fast                 | Slower due to searching for space |
| Size        | Small and limited              | Large and flexible                |
| Structure   | Strict LIFO                    | Hierarchical and fragmented       |
| Usage       | Temporary local variables      | Dynamic data that changes         |

Variables on the stack are automatically cleaned up when their function returns. Variables on the heap must be garbage-collected. Your goal should be to keep as much on the stack as possible.

## Patterns to Reduce GC Pressure

### Prefer the stack over the heap

Pass by value — don't pass pointers for large variables or structures unless they actually need to be mutated at a project level.

```go
// Good — stays on stack
func processUser(u User) { ... }

// Only use if mutation is needed
func processUser(u *User) { ... }
```

### Avoid interface boxing

Assigning a concrete type to an `interface{}` or `any` causes escape to the heap.

```go
// Bad: forces heap allocation
var v interface{} = 42

// Better: use concrete types
var v int = 42
```

### Use escape analysis

Run the compiler with escape analysis flags during development to see exactly why variables escape to the heap:

```bash
go build -gcflags="-m"
```

This tells you exactly why a variable escapes to the heap before you even hit production profiling.

### Reorder struct fields

Reorder struct fields in decreasing size to avoid empty padding (alignment padding).

```go
// Bad: 24 bytes due to padding
type Bad struct {
    a bool    // 1 byte + 7 padding
    b int64   // 8 bytes
    c bool    // 1 byte + 7 padding
}

// Good: 16 bytes, no wasted space
type Good struct {
    b int64   // 8 bytes
    a bool    // 1 byte
    c bool    // 1 byte
    // 6 bytes padding at end
}
```

### Preallocate and reuse memory

Preallocate slice capacity when you know the expected size:

```go
// Bad: grows dynamically, causes reallocations
var items []int
for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    items = append(items, i)
}

// Good: preallocate
items := make([]int, 0, 1000)
for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    items = append(items, i)
}
```

Use `sync.Pool` to recycle short-lived structs or buffers:

```go
var pool = sync.Pool{
    New: func() any {
        return &bytes.Buffer{}
    },
}

buf := pool.Get().(*bytes.Buffer)
buf.Reset()
defer pool.Put(buf)
```

### Managing slices

Use a copy instead of slicing large arrays to avoid keeping the entire backing array alive:

```go
// Bad: keeps whole large array alive
data := readLargeFile() // returns []byte
chunk := data[100:200]

// Good: copy only what you need
chunk := make([]byte, 100)
copy(chunk, data[100:200])
```

### Manage goroutines with pools

Minimize blocking calls. Use worker pools and `sync.Pool` to control concurrency:

```go
worker := make(chan struct{}, 100) // pool of 100 workers
```

## Profiling Measures

Never guess where your memory is going. Use profiling to identify true bottlenecks.

### pprof

Analyze heap usage with Go's built-in profiler:

```bash
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
```

### Escape analysis during builds

```bash
go build -gcflags="-m" 2>&1 | grep "escapes to heap"
```

This catches escape issues during development, before they reach production.

## Summary

| Technique                 | Benefit                               |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Pass by value             | Keeps data on stack                   |
| Avoid interface boxing    | Prevents heap escape                  |
| Reorder struct fields     | Reduces memory padding                |
| Preallocate slices        | Avoids reallocation overhead          |
| sync.Pool                 | Reuses short-lived objects            |
| Copy slice data           | Prevents large backing array retention|
| Use pprof                 | Identifies real memory bottlenecks    |
| Escape analysis flags     | Catches heap escapes during build     |

Understanding Go's memory model and GC behavior is essential for writing efficient, production-ready systems. The key takeaway: **measure first, optimize second**, and always prefer the stack when possible.
